            Because RxUI.dll is in a PLib, it doesn't have the SuperPowers it needs
            to be able to really detect whether it's in a unit test runner. This class
            is much better at it.

            Ignore me. This class is a secret handshake between RxUI and RxUI.Xaml
            in order to register certain classes on startup that would be difficult
            to register otherwise.

            <summary>
            AutoDataTemplateBindingHook is a binding hook that checks ItemsControls
            that don't have DataTemplates, and assigns a default DataTemplate that
            loads the View associated with each ViewModel.

            This control hosts the View associated with a Router, and will display
            the View and wire up the ViewModel whenever a new ViewModel is
            navigated to. Put this control as the only control in your Window.

            This content control will automatically load the View associated with
            the ViewModel property and display it. This control is very useful
            inside a DataTemplate to display the View associated with a ViewModel.
